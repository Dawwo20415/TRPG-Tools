# TRPG-Tools
A series of tools for both Players and DMs

Here are all the tools that I plan to make

 - Player-Tool => Character Sheet digital substitute and datrabase can connect with DM personal database
 - DM-Tool => Smart Digital DM screen with information that can be connected to a personal database for homebrew worlds, being able to access your players' character sheet and info
 
 First built for D&D 5e later on will add other systems maybe even the possibility of creating custom systems
